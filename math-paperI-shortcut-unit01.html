        <h2 class="sub-heading">Derivatives and Differentiation</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Derivability and Derivative:</strong> <br>

            Derivability refers to the ability of a function to have a derivative.<br>
            A derivative, denoted by f'(x) or dy/dx, gives the rate of change of a function with respect to its independent variable.<br>
            It tells us how much the function changes for a small change in its input variable.<br><br>

            <strong>Derived Function:</strong> <br>
            
            The derived function is the derivative of the original function.<br>
            It is obtained by finding the derivative of a function with respect to its independent variable.<br>
            For example, if f(x) = x^2, then f'(x) = 2x.<br><br>

            <strong>Derivability Implying Continuity:</strong> <br>

            A function is said to be continuous at a point if the limit of the function at that point <br>
            exists and is equal to the value of the function at that point.<br>
            If a function is differentiable at a point, then it is also continuous at that point.<br><br>

            <strong>Geometrical Interpretation of a Derivative:</strong> <br>

            The derivative of a function at a point represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point.<br>
            The tangent line touches the graph of the function at only one point, unlike a secant line which passes through two points of <br>
            the graph. The derivative gives us the instantaneous rate of change of the function at a particular point.<br><br>

            <strong>Higher Order Derivatives:</strong> <br>

            The derivative of a derivative is called a second-order derivative.<br>
            The derivative of a second-order derivative is called a third-order derivative, and so on.<br>
            Higher order derivatives are useful in analyzing the behavior of a function, especially at critical points like maxima and minima.<br><br>

            <strong>Leibnitz Theorem:</strong> <br>

            Leibnitz's theorem provides a method to find the derivative of a product of two functions.<br>
            It states that the derivative of the product of two functions is equal to the first function <br>
            times the derivative of the second function plus the second function times the derivative of the first function.<br>
            It is a useful tool for solving problems involving products of functions.<br><br>

            <strong>Real-World Applications:</strong> <br>

            The concept of derivatives and differentiation is used extensively in physics, engineering, <br>
            and economics to model and analyze the behavior of systems.<br>
            For example, the rate of change of velocity with respect to time gives acceleration in physics.<br>
            The concept of derivatives is also used in finance to model and analyze financial derivatives such <br>
            as options and futures contracts.<br><br>

            <strong>Example:</strong> <br>

            Suppose you are driving a car, and your speedometer reads 50 km/h. <br>
            The speedometer gives you the average speed over a short interval of time. <br>
            However, to know your instantaneous speed, you need to find the derivative <br>
            of the distance traveled with respect to time. <br>
            If the distance traveled is given by the function f(t) = 5t^2, where t is time in seconds, then the <br>
            derivative of f(t) gives you the instantaneous speed of the car at any time t.

        <p>
            <strong>Maclaurin's Theorem:</strong><br>
            Maclaurin's theorem is a special case of Taylor's theorem, where the center of <br>
            the approximation is at x = 0.<br>
            It states that any infinitely differentiable function can be represented by a <br>
            power series expansion at x = 0.<br>
            The coefficients of the power series are given by the derivatives of the <br>
            function evaluated at x = 0.<br><br>

            <strong>Taylor's Theorem:</strong><br>
            Taylor's theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to approximate a <br>
            function with a polynomial.<br>
            It states that any infinitely differentiable function can be represented by <br>
            a power series expansion around a given center x = a.<br>
            The coefficients of the power series are given by the derivatives of the <br>
            function evaluated at x = a.<br><br>

            <strong>Equations of Tangent and Normal:</strong><br>
            The tangent to a curve at a point is a straight line that touches the curve at <br>
            that point and has the same slope as the curve at that point.<br>
            The equation of the tangent at a point (a, f(a)) is given by y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a), <br>
            where f'(a) is the derivative of the function at point a.<br>
            The normal to a curve at a point is a straight line that is perpendicular <br>
            to the tangent at that point.<br>
            The equation of the normal at a point (a, f(a)) is given by y - f(a) = -1/f'(a)(x - a), <br>
            where f'(a) is the derivative of the function at point a.<br><br>

            <strong>Real-World Applications:</strong><br>
            The concept of Taylor series expansion is widely used in physics, engineering, <br>
            and computer science to approximate complex functions with simpler ones.<br>
            For example, the Taylor series expansion of sine function is used to approximate <br>
            oscillatory behavior in electrical circuits and mechanical systems.<br>
            The concept of tangents and normals is used in computer graphics to simulate the <br>
            reflection of light rays off curved surfaces.<br><br>

            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            Suppose you have a function f(x) = x^2. To find the equation of the tangent and <br>
            normal to the curve at the point x = 1, we need to first find the derivative of the function, <br>
            which is f'(x) = 2x. Evaluating f'(1) gives us the slope of the tangent and normal at the point x = 1, <br>
            which is 2.<br><br>

            The equation of the tangent is y - 1 = 2(x - 1), or y = 2x - 1.<br>
            The equation of the normal is y - 1 = -1/2(x - 1), or y = -1/2x + 3/2.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Mean Value Theorems</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Rolle's Theorem:</strong><br>
            Rolle's theorem is a theorem in calculus that states that if a function f(x) <br>
            is continuous on the closed interval [a, b], differentiable on the open interval <br>
            (a, b), and f(a) = f(b), then there exists at least one point c in (a, b) such that f'(c) = 0.<br>
            In other words, if a function takes the same value at two points, <br>
            then there must be a point in between where the derivative is zero.<br><br>

            <strong>Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem:</strong><br>
            Lagrange's mean value theorem is a theorem in calculus that states that if a <br>
            function f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a, b], differentiable on <br>
            the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in (a, b) <br>
            such that f'(c) = [f(b) - f(a)]/(b - a).<br>
            In other words, the theorem guarantees the existence of a point c in (a, b) <br>
            where the slope of the tangent to the curve equals the average rate of change <br>
            of the function over the interval [a, b].<br><br>

            <strong>Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem:</strong><br>
            Cauchy's mean value theorem is a generalization of Lagrange's mean value theorem.<br>
            It states that if two functions f(x) and g(x) are continuous on the closed <br>
            interval [a, b], differentiable on the open interval (a, b), and g'(x) is <br>
            non-zero for all x in (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in (a, b) <br>
            such that [f(b) - f(a)]/[g(b) - g(a)] = f'(c)/g'(c).<br>
            In other words, the theorem guarantees the existence of a point c in (a, b) <br>
            where the ratio of the change in f to the change in g equals the ratio of the <br>
            derivative of f to the derivative of g.<br><br>

            <strong>Real-World Applications:</strong><br>
            The mean value theorem is used in physics to describe the behavior of objects in <br>
            motion, such as the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object over time.<br>
            It is also used in economics to model changes in production and consumption over time.<br><br>

            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            Suppose you have a function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 defined on the interval [0, 3]. <br>
            To apply Rolle's theorem, we need to first check that f(x) satisfies the conditions <br>
            of the theorem.<br><br>

            f(x) is continuous on [0, 3] and differentiable on (0, 3).<br>
            Also, f(0) = 3 and f(3) = 0, so f(0) = f(3).<br><br>

            By Rolle's theorem, there exists at least one point c in (0, 3) such that f'(c) = 0. <br>
            Solving for c, we get c = 2, which is the point where the tangent to the curve is horizontal.<br>
            To apply Lagrange's mean value theorem, we need to find a point c in (0, 3) <br>
            such that f'(c) = [f(3) - f(0)]/(3 - 0). <br>
            Solving for c, we get c = 2, w<br>
            hich is the same as the point obtained by Rolle's theorem.<br>
            To apply Cauchy's mean value theorem, we need to find a point c in (0, 3) such that [f(3) - f(0)]
