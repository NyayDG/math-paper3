                <li>Methods of Integration: There are several methods of integration, <br>
                    but the most common ones are substitution, integration by parts, and partial fractions. <br>
                    Substitution involves substituting a function with a variable and then integrating it. <br>
                    Integration by parts involves breaking a function into two parts and integrating each <br>
                    part separately. Partial fractions is a technique used to decompose a rational function <br>
                    into simpler fractions that can be easily integrated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Partial Fractions: Partial fractions is a method of breaking down a complex fraction into <br>
                    simpler fractions. The technique is useful when trying to integrate a rational function. <br>
                    The steps involved in partial fractions include finding the common denominator, <br>
                    identifying the numerator coefficients, and equating the numerators to simplify the equation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Integration of Algebraic Rational Functions by Substitution: This technique involves <br>
                    substituting a variable or a function in the integral to simplify the equation. <br>
                    For example, if we have an integral that includes a square root, we can substitute <br>
                    the function inside the square root to make it simpler to integrate. The key to this <br>
                    method is finding the right substitution that will simplify the equation.

            <p>To remember these concepts, you can try the following tips:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Methods of Integration: You can remember the three common methods of integration <br>
                    using the acronym SIP: substitution, integration by parts, and partial fractions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Partial Fractions: To remember the steps involved in partial fractions, <br>
                    you can use the acronym CINE: common denominator, identify numerator coefficients, <br>
                    numerator equation, and simplify.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Integration by Substitution: To remember this method, you can think of it as solving a puzzle. <br>
                    You need to find the right substitution that will simplify the equation, just like finding the <br>
                    right piece to complete a puzzle.

                Real-world applications of integration include calculating areas, volumes, <br>
                and other quantities in physics, engineering, and finance. For example, <br>
                the area under a curve can be found using integration, and this concept is <br>
                used in calculating the area of irregular shapes or volumes of 3D objects.<br><br>

                Here's an example problem to help you understand these concepts better:<br>
                Find the integral of (3x+2)/(x^2+2x+1) using partial fractions.<br><br>

                Solution:
                First, we need to factor the denominator to get (x+1)^2. <br>
                We can then write the numerator as A/(x+1) + B/(x+1)^2. <br>
                We can then equate the numerators to get 3x+2 = A(x+1) + B. <br>
                By substituting x=-1, we get A=-1. By substituting x=0, we get B=5. <br>
                Therefore, the integral becomes -ln|x+1| + 5/(x+1) + C, <br>
                where C is the constant of integration.

                Real-world applications of integration of irrational algebraic functions include calculating areas and volumes <br>
                in physics and engineering. For example, the integral of a function that represents the cross-sectional area <br>
                of a solid can be used to calculate the volume of the solid.<br><br>
                            
                Here's an example problem to help you understand these concepts better:<br>                            
                Find the integral of √(4x^2 + 9)dx.<br><br>
                            
                Solution:<br>
                We can use the substitution method to simplify the integral. Let u = 2x/3, so du/dx = 2/3. <br>
                We can then rewrite the integral as (3/2)∫√(4u^2 + 9)du. We can use the method of completing <br>
                the square to simplify the expression under the square root. <br>
                This gives us (3/2)∫√(4(u^2 + 9/4))du = (3/2)∫2√((u^2 + 9/4))du. <br>
                We can then make the substitution v = u^2 + 9/4, so dv/dx = 2u/3. <br>
                This gives us (3/4)∫√v dv. <br>
                We can integrate this expression using the power rule to get (3/4)(2/3)v^(3/2) + C = (1/2)(2x/3)(4x^2 + 9)^(1/2) + C. <br>
                Therefore, the integral of √(4x^2 + 9)dx is (1/2)(2x/3)(4x^2 + 9)^(1/2) + C.

                used to model the motion of a mass-spring system or an electrical circuit.<br><br>

                Here's an example problem to help you understand these concepts better:<br><br>

                Find the integral of sin^4 x dx.<br><br>

                Solution:<br>
                We can use the reduction formula for sin^2 x to simplify the integral. <br>
                This formula is ∫ sin^2 x dx = (1/2) (x - sin x cos x) + C. <br>
                We can rewrite sin^4 x as (sin^2 x)^2 and then use the reduction formula twice <br>
                to get ∫ sin^4 x dx = ∫ sin^2 x (sin^2 x) dx = (1/2) ∫ (1 - cos 2x) (sin^2 x) dx = (1/2) (∫ sin^2 x dx - ∫ cos 2x sin^2 x dx).<br> 
                We can use the reduction formula for sin^2 x to evaluate the first integral and <br>
                the substitution method to evaluate the second integral.<br><br>

                Let's start by evaluating the first integral, ∫ sin^2 x dx. Using the reduction formula, we get:<br><br>
                
                ∫ sin^2 x dx = (1/2) (x - sin x cos x) + C<br><br>
                
                Now, let's evaluate the second integral, ∫ cos 2x sin^2 x dx. We can use substitution here <br>
                by letting u = sin x, so that du/dx = cos x and dx = du/cos x. Substituting these into the integral, we get:<br><br>
                
                ∫ cos 2x sin^2 x dx = ∫ cos 2x u^2 du/cos x<br>
                = ∫ (1 - 2sin^2 x) u^2 du<br>
                = ∫ u^2 - 2u^4 du<br>
                = (1/3) u^3 - (2/5) u^5 + C<br>
                = (1/3) sin^3 x - (2/5) sin^5 x + C<br><br>
                
                Substituting the results back into the original formula, we get:<br><br>
                
                ∫ sin^4 x dx = (1/2) (∫ sin^2 x dx - ∫ cos 2x sin^2 x dx)<br>
                = (1/2) ((1/2) (x - sin x cos x) - [(1/3) sin^3 x - (2/5) sin^5 x] ) + C<br>
                = (1/4) (x - sin x cos x) - (1/6) sin^3 x + (1/10) sin^5 x + C <br><br>
                
                So the integral of sin^4 x dx is (1/4) (x - sin x cos x) - (1/6) sin^3 x + (1/10) sin^5 x + C.

                Real-world applications of beta, gamma functions, and multiple integrals include calculating <br>
                probabilities in statistics, modeling physical systems in physics and engineering, and computing <br>
                the volume of irregularly shaped objects in geometry and computer graphics.<br><br>

                Here's an example problem to help you understand these concepts better:<br><br>

                Find the volume of the solid bounded by the cylinder x^2 + y^2 = 1 and the planes z = 0 and z = x + y.<br><br>

                Solution:<br><br>
                We can use double integrals to find the volume of the solid. First, we need to sketch the region of integration, <br>
                which is the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1 in the xy-plane. We can choose to integrate either in the order dz dy dx or dz dx dy, <br>
                but it is easier to integrate in the order dz dy dx in this case.<br><br>

                Let V be the volume of the solid. Then we have:<br><br>
                
                V = ∫∫R (x + y) - 0 dA<br><br>
                
                where R is the region of integration (the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1). We can convert the integral to polar coordinates <br>
                by letting x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ, so that:<br><br>
                
                V = ∫ from 0 to 2π ∫ from 0 to 1 [(r cos θ + r sin θ) - 0] r dr dθ<br><br>
                
                Simplifying the integral, we get:<br><br>
                
                V = ∫ from 0 to 2π ∫ from 0 to 1 r^2 (cos θ + sin θ) dr dθ<br>
                = ∫ from 0 to 2π [(1/3) r^3 (cos θ + sin θ)] from 0 to 1 dθ<br>
                = ∫ from 0 to 2π (1/3) (cos θ + sin θ) dθ<br>
                = (1/3) [sin θ - cos θ] from 0 to 2π<br>
                = (1/3) [sin 2π - sin 0 - cos 2π + cos 0]<br>
                = (1/3) (0 - 0 - 1 + 1)<br>
                = 0 <br><br>
                
                Therefore, the volume of the solid bounded by the cylinder x^2 + y^2 = 1 and the planes z = 0 and z = x + y is zero.
